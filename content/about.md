## Hey there, I am  [Sachin](https://linkedin.com/in/sachinkumardhaka)ðŸ‘‹
  

I completed my BTech in Computer Science & Engineering from Malaviya National Institute of Technology, Jaipur in May 2024 and am currently working as a Security Engineer at a US-based cybersecurity firm in the purple team. I am deeply passionate about cyber security, with interests ranging from network security to low-level systems.

To stay sharp and continually evolve my skills, I actively participate in Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges. I also focus on web exploitation, kernel pwns, and occasionally delve into hypervisors.

Whether finding vulnerabilities or building secure systems, I aim to make a meaningful impact in the field of cybersecurity. When I'm not immersed in work or CTFs, you can find me blogging about information security at [https://s4ch.github.io/](https://s4ch.github.io/).

## Hey there, I'm [Sachin](https://linkedin.com/in/sachinkumardhaka) ðŸ‘‹

Security Engineer from India working with a US cybersecurity firm, doing purple team work. Got my BTech from MNIT Jaipur in 2024.

I focus on **eBPF security**, **EDR research**, and **threat intelligence**. My work ranges from analyzing eBPF internals to hunting down C2 infrastructure and tracking phishing campaigns.

## What I'm Into

**eBPF Security**: JIT compilers, verifier bypasses, and detection/evasion techniques

**EDR Research**: Understanding detection engines and bypass methods  

**Threat Intelligence**: Tracking threat actors, analyzing phishing campaigns, and hunting C2 infrastructure

**Binary Exploitation**: Reverse engineering and vulnerability research

**Purple Team Operations**: Building detections and threat hunting

## Experience & Learning

I work with GDB, eBPF, EDR reverse engineering, and C2 traffic analysis. Most of my research gets documented in blog posts.

Solved 100+ CTF challenges across HackTheBox, TryHackMe, and competitions. Completed pwn.college modules for binary exploitation fundamentals. My [writeups](https://github.com/S4CH/s4ch.github.io/tree/main-old/writeups) cover beginner to advanced exploitation techniques.

Background in phishing campaign analysis and C2 infrastructure hunting - connecting IOCs and tracking threat actor patterns. Currently exploring how eBPF impacts both offensive and defensive security.

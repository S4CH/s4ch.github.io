# CyFun's Blog

<p>
Welcome to my blog! This blog covers a wide range of topics, including reverse engineering, kernel level exploit development, red teaming, network security, CTFs, etc. 

I decide to publish my new blog on hugo instead of docusaurus. For me keeping up with docusaurus was very difficult and cliche, breaking the stuff everytime I build. Btw 100+ writeups from Hackthebox and Tryhackme are still there you find it in main-old branch (https://github.com/S4CH/s4ch.github.io/tree/main-old)

You can check it out at [s4ch.github.io](https://s4ch.github.io)

Connect with me on social media as we explore the offensive side of security together.

&lt;p>eBPF has become ubiquitous in modern Linux systems, powering everything from network filtering to system observability tools.While the eBPF verifier gets most of the security attention, the Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler that translates eBPF bytecode to native machine instructions contains equally fascinating security mechanisms that deserve deeper analysis.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How Attackers Are Weaponizing OAuth to Silently Take Over Microsoft Outlook Accounts</title><link>https://s4ch.github.io/blog/oath-exploited-by-attackers/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Nov 2024 06:30:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://s4ch.github.io/blog/oath-exploited-by-attackers/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="tldr">TL;DR&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Last week, while investigating some suspicious Microsoft Outlook activity for a client at iZOOlogic, I stumbled upon something that made my heart sink for a while. What started as a routine incident response engagement turned into the discovery of one of the most sophisticated OAuth phishing campaigns I&amp;rsquo;ve seen in my experience so far of security research.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s the kicker - this attack doesn&amp;rsquo;t steal your password. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t care about your MFA. Instead, it tricks you into granting a malicious application complete access to your mailbox, and it does it so smoothly that most users won&amp;rsquo;t think twice before clicking &amp;ldquo;Accept.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Novel approach to tackle UAF Bugs in the Linux Kernel</title><link>https://s4ch.github.io/blog/bucket-allocators/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Sep 2024 06:30:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://s4ch.github.io/blog/bucket-allocators/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hi, kernel and sec enthusiasts! It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since my last post(2022), but I&amp;rsquo;ve got something juicy for you today. We are going to dive into an exciting new proposal that aims to bolster the Linux kernel&amp;rsquo;s defenses against those persistent use-after-free (UAF) vulnerabilities. Grab your favorite beverage or drink(Try Amul Kool once, Thank me later), because we&amp;rsquo;re about to get our hands dirty with some kernel internals!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;ve been in the low-level security for a while, you&amp;rsquo;re probably sick of hearing about UAF vulnerabilities. But for those who need a refresher, UAFs occur when a program continues to use a pointer to memory after it&amp;rsquo;s been freed. This can lead to all sorts of fun exploitation scenarios, especially in kernel-land where the stakes are highest.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://s4ch.github.io/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://s4ch.github.io/about/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="hey-there-i-am--sachin">Hey there, I am &lt;a href="https://linkedin.com/in/sachinkumardhaka">Sachin&lt;/a>ðŸ‘‹&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I completed my BTech in Computer Science &amp;amp; Engineering from Malaviya National Institute of Technology, Jaipur in May 2024 and am currently working as a Security Engineer at a US-based cybersecurity firm in the purple team. I am deeply passionate about cyber security, with interests ranging from network security to low-level systems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To stay sharp and continually evolve my skills, I actively participate in Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges. I also focus on web exploitation, kernel pwns, and occasionally delve into hypervisors.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Contact</title><link>https://s4ch.github.io/contact/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://s4ch.github.io/contact/</guid><description>How to get in touch</description></item></channel></rss>

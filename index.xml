It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since my last post(2022), but I&amp;rsquo;ve got something juicy for you today. We are going to dive into an exciting new proposal that aims to bolster the Linux kernel&amp;rsquo;s defenses against those persistent use-after-free (UAF) vulnerabilities. Grab your favorite beverage or drink(Try Amul Kool once, Thank me later), because we&amp;rsquo;re about to get our hands dirty with some kernel internals!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;ve been in the low-level security for a while, you&amp;rsquo;re probably sick of hearing about UAF vulnerabilities. But for those who need a refresher, UAFs occur when a program continues to use a pointer to memory after it&amp;rsquo;s been freed. This can lead to all sorts of fun exploitation scenarios, especially in kernel-land where the stakes are highest.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://s4ch.github.io/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://s4ch.github.io/about/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="hey-there-i-am--sachinhttpslinkedincominsachinkumardhaka">Hey there, I am &lt;a href="https://linkedin.com/in/sachinkumardhaka">Sachin&lt;/a>ðŸ‘‹&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I completed my BTech in Computer Science &amp;amp; Engineering from Malaviya National Institute of Technology, Jaipur in May 2024 and am currently working as a Security Engineer at a US-based cybersecurity firm in the purple team. I am deeply passionate about cyber security, with interests ranging from network security to low-level systems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To stay sharp and continually evolve my skills, I actively participate in Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges. I also focus on web exploitation, kernel pwns, and occasionally delve into hypervisors.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Contact</title><link>https://s4ch.github.io/contact/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://s4ch.github.io/contact/</guid><description>How to get in touch</description></item></channel></rss>

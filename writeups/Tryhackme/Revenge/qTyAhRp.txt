To whom it may concern,

I know it was you who hacked my blog.  I was really impressed with your skills.  You were a little sloppy 
and left a bit of a footprint so I was able to track you down.  But, thank you for taking me up on my offer.  
I've done some initial enumeration of the site because I know *some* things about hacking but not enough.  
For that reason, I'll let you do your own enumeration and checking.

What I want you to do is simple.  Break into the server that's running the website and deface the front page.  
I don't care how you do it, just do it.  But remember...DO NOT BRING DOWN THE SITE!  We don't want to cause irreparable damage.

When you finish the job, you'll get the rest of your payment.  We agreed upon $5,000.  
Half up-front and half when you finish.

Good luck,

Billy

# Internal

Penetration Testing Challenge

[Internal](https://tryhackme.com/room/internal)

## ðŸ’¢ We will cover  the topics

- Network Enumeration
- Web Enumeration
- Enumeration (Wordpress)
- Exploitation (Wordpress)



---------------------------------

## Task 1 Pre-engagement Briefing

You have been assigned to a client that wants a penetration test conducted on an environment due to be released to production in three weeks.

**Scope of Work**

The client requests that an engineer conducts an external, web app, and internal assessment of the provided virtual environment. The client has asked that minimal information be provided about the assessment, wanting the engagement conducted from the eyes of a malicious actor (black box penetration test). The client has asked that you secure two flags (no location provided) as proof of exploitation:

- User.txt
- Root.txt

Additionally, the client has provided the following scope allowances:

- Ensure that you modify your hosts file to reflect internal.thm
- Any tools or techniques are permitted in this engagement
- Locate and note all vulnerabilities found
- Submit the flags discovered to the dashboard
- Only the IP address assigned to your machine is in scope

**(Roleplay off)**

I encourage you to approach this challenge as an actual penetration test. Consider writing a report, to include an executive summary, vulnerability and exploitation assessment, and remediation suggestions, as this will benefit you in preparation for the eLearnsecurity eCPPT or career as a penetration tester in the field.

Note - this room can be completed without Metasploit

**Please do not stream this challenge in the first seven days of release (August 21, 2020)**

1. I understand the scope of work

## Task 2 Deploy and Engage the Client Environment

Having accepted the project, you are provided with the client assessment environment. Secure the User and Root flags and submit them to the dashboard as proof of exploitation.

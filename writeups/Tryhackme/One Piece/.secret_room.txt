Inuarashi: You reached the center of the Whale, the majestic tree of Zou.
Nekomamushi: We have hidden this place for centuries.
Inuarashi: Indeed, it holds a secret.
Nekomamushi: Do you see this red stele ? This is a Road Poneglyph.
Luffy: A Road Poneglyph ??
Inuarashi: There are four Road Poneglyphs around the world. Each of them gives one of the key to reach Laugh Tale and to find the One Piece.
Luffy: The One Piece ?? That's my dream ! I will find it and I will become the Pirate King !!!
Nekomamushi: A lot have tried but only one succeeded over the centuries, Gol D Roger, the former Pirate King.
Inuarashi: It is commonly known that both Emperors, Big Mom and Kaido, own a Road Poneglyph but no one knows where is the last one.
Nekomamushi: The other issue is the power of Big Mom and Kaido, they are Emperor due to their strength, you won't be able to take them down easily.
Luffy: I will show them, there can be only one Pirate King and it will be me !!
Inuarashi: There is another issue regarding the Road Poneglyph.
Nekomamushi: They are written in an ancient language and a very few people around the world can actually read them.

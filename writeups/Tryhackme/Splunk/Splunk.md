# Splunk

Part of the Blue Primer series, learn how to use Splunk to search through massive amounts of information

[Splunk](https://tryhackme.com/room/bpsplunk)

## ðŸ’¢ We will cover  the topics

* Splunk Fundamentals
* System Forensic

## Task 1 Deploy!

Deploy the Splunk virtual machine. **This can take up to five to ten minutes to launch. If the webpage does not load for you after ten minutes, terminate and relaunch the machine.**

* **Username**: splunkUser
* **Password**: SplunkUser#321

The first section of this room consists of a quiz over Splunk. I recommend attempting the quiz while the machine loads as it can take some time. If the VM fails to load, a direct link to the OVA file (Splunk) can be found [here](https://darkstar7471.com/resources.html). You can also build this manually using the data and instructions found at this [link](https://github.com/splunk/botsv1).

Deploy the virtual machine and connect to the website found at BOX_IP:8000

## Task 2 Can you dig it?

A short quiz over the base search commands that are useful for Splunk. All you'll need for this is the attached quick reference guide and possibly the magic of Google. Include all parts of the search query unless otherwise instructed.

Splunk queries always begin with this command implicitly unless otherwise specified. What command is this? When performing additional queries to refine received data this command must be added at the start. This is a prime example of a slight trick question.

`search command is used to look up for things you actually wanna look up in the whole data.`

`search`

When searching for values, it's fairly typical within security to look for uncommon events. What command can we include within our search to find these?

`rare command gives you the top 5 or 10 least common result while the top command gives you the top most`

`rare`

What about the inverse? What if we want the most common security event?

`top`

When we import data into splunk, what is it stored under?

`itâ€™s like a repository of the data.`

`index`

We can create 'views' that allow us to consistently pull up the same search over and over again; what are these called?

`dashboard`

Importing data doesn't always go as planned and we can sometimes end up with multiple copies of the same data, what command do we include in our search to remove these copies?

`deduplicates data.`

`dedup`

Splunk can be used for more than just a SIEM and it's commonly used in marketing to track things such as how long a shopping trip on a website lasts from start to finish. What command can we include in our search to track how long these event pairs take?

`transaction`

In a manner similar to Linux, we can 'pipe' search results into further commands, what character do we use for this?

`pipe`

`|`

In performing data analytics with Splunk (ironically what the tool is at it's core) it's useful to track occurrences of events over time, what command do we include to plot this?

`timechart`

What about if we want to gather general statistical information about a search?

`stats`

Data imported into Splunk is categorized into columns called what?

`fields`

When we import data into Splunk we can view it's point of origination, what is this called? I'm looking for the machine aspect of this here.

`host`

When we import data into Splunk we can view its point of origination from within a system, what is this called?

`source`

We can classify these points of origination and group them all together, viewing them as their specific type. What is this called? Use the syntax found within the search query rather than the proper name for this.

`sourcetype`

When performing functions on data we are searching through we use a specific command prior to the evaluation itself, what is this command?

`eval`

Love it or hate it regular expression is a massive component to Splunk, what command do we use to specific regex within a search?

`rex`

It's fairly common to create subsets and specific views for less technical Splunk users, what are these called?

`pivot tables`

What is the proper name of the time date field in Splunk

`_time`

How do I specifically include only the first few values found within my search?

`head`

More useful than you would otherwise imagine, how do I flip the order that results are returned in?

`reverse`

When viewing search results, it's often useful to rename fields using user-provided tables of values. What command do we include within a search to do this?

`lookup`

We can collect events into specific time frames to be used in further processing. What command do we include within a search to do just that?

`bucket`

We can also define data into specific sections of time to be used within chart commands, what command do we use to set these lengths of time? This is different from the previous question as we are no longer collecting for further processing.

`span`

When producing statistics regarding a search it's common to number the occurrences of an event, what command do we include to do this?

`count`

Last but not least, what is the website where you can find the Splunk apps at?

`splunkbase.splunk.com`

We can also add new features into Splunk, what are these called?

`apps`

What does SOC stand for?

`security operations center`

What does SIEM stand for?

`security information and event management`

How about BOTS?

`you can just see this given in Task 3 description.`

`boss of the soc`

And CIM?

`Splunk CMI`

`common information model`

what is the website where you can find the Splunk forums at?

`answers.splunk.com`

## Task 3 BOTS!

Following our delightful introduction to Splunk with our command quiz, we'll be visiting some of the training material that Splunk has directly generated as part of their 'Boss of the SOC' Security Operations Center competition!

## Task 4 Halp, I'm drowning in logs!

Navigate to the webpage found at 10.10.235.162:8000 on the machine you've deployed for this room. The credentials for logging into Splunk are as follows:

* **Username**: splunkUser
* **Password**: SplunkUser#321

![](https://i.imgur.com/HHmY6QZ.png)

Navigate to the 'Investigating with Splunk Workshop' App on the left side of the screen following login. You'll be greeted with the following images:

**Website Defacement**

**An Example Cerber Ransomware Infection, an Unfortunately Common Real Ransomware**

![](https://i.imgur.com/Zj1umcF.png)

These two images are the two scenarios we will be working through throughout this room. In addition to this, we will be using Lockheed Martin's Kill Chain to break down each attack and report it accordingly.

Start reading through the Overview and navigate through it until you are ready to begin the APT!

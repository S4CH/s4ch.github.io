<h3>Heyya!</h3>

I am Sachin, a second year undergrad at the Department Of Computer Science and Engineering in  <a href="https://mnit.ac.in/">Malaviya National Institute of Technology, Jaipur</a>
</p>
I am fascinated and interested in almost all fields of cybersecurity specifically OSINT, GEOINT, Cryptography, Reverse Engineering, Binary Exploitation and Programming in general and usually you find me online with a sock name <b>CyFun</b>.


This personal blog is aimed towards documenting my interests, research and interesting finds. The [blog](/blog/) category includes blogs about random topics and [Threads](/docs/) category includes well documented series about a specific topic in much detail.
<p>
If you're interested in cysec and infosec stuff,<a href="https://linkedin.com/in/sachinkkumardhaka"> LinkedIn</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/cy5un"> Twitter</a> are good avenues or shoot me an <a href="mailto:contact@cyfun.me"> email</a>.

<h3>Heyya!</h3>

I am Sachin, a pre-final year undergrad at the Department Of Computer Science and Engineering in  <a href="https://mnit.ac.in/">Malaviya National Institute of Technology, Jaipur</a>
</p>
I find practically all aspects of cybersecurity fascinating and interesting, but my particular areas of interest include OSINT, GEOINT, Cryptography, Reverse Engineering, Binary Exploitation, and programming in general. You can typically find me online under the sock name <b>CyFun</b>.

This personal blog is intended to serve as a record of my hobbies, research, and intriguing discoveries.
The [Blurb](/blog/) category comprises blogs about arbitrary subjects, [Threads](/docs/) category offers meticulously researched series about a certain subject, [CTF](/ctf/) category contains capture the flag competitions that take place on ctftime and [Scrawlings](/writeups/) category includes HackTheBox and Tryhackme.

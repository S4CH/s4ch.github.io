# IntroductionüàÇÔ∏è

The traditional physical security measures of ‚Äúguns, guards, and gates‚Äù are no longer enough for today‚Äôs organizations. Many control system environments have effective physical security measures in place in addition to the traditional ‚Äúthree Gs‚Äù listed above.

For example, additional measures could be the use of camera monitoring, electronic entryways that deny access to anyone without the proper credentials, and keypad locks. However, physical protection and control are also the responsibility of individual employees.

This section covers protection measures you can take at work, when traveling, and at home.

## Protection Measuresüõ°Ô∏è

- At Home
    
    
    If you use or store work computer systems or information at your home, provide the same level of physical protection that you would at work.
    
    - Do not allow others without a need to know to access or use your system or information.
    - Ensure your home is secure when leaving systems and data. If possible, store the system and data in a locked room or locked storage container when unattended.
    - Do not leave systems or storage media in your vehicle.
    - Report the theft of company property from your home in accordance with your organization's policies.
    
- At Work
    
    
    Being vigilant is key to physically protecting information assets. Some of your responsibilities may include:
    
    - Know your environment and take appropriate action when something is out of the ordinary.
    - Be aware of who is behind you (and who may try to ‚Äúpiggyback‚Äù) when you are entering a restricted area.
    - Limit access to systems you are responsible for to those who have a need-to-know.
    - When appropriate, use a password-protected screensaver or some other lockout method when leaving a system unattended.
    - Close and lock your office door when you leave for extended periods.
    - Supervise the use and maintenance of your systems.
    - Do not leave critical documents or systems (including systems that store critical information) unattended in a publicly accessible area (such as a conference room or building lobby).
    
- When Travelling
    
    
    When you‚Äôre traveling, your information and computer systems (e.g., laptop, smartphone, etc.) are at even greater risk of theft or unauthorized access. Take the following precautions when traveling:
    
    - Do not leave systems unattended during travel. If possible, transport your systems in your carry-on bags instead of checked bags.
    - Pay attention when going through airport security. Thieves may be able to steal your laptop while you are focusing on getting through the security checkpoint.
    - Whenever possible, don't leave systems in an unattended hotel room. If you are unable to take your system with you, use the hotel safe if one is available.
    - Avoid accessing critical information on your laptop or other device on the airplane or other public places. If you must access critical information, use screen filters to prevent the information from being read by others.
    

## Defense-in-Depth Approach

***Defense-in-depth*** refers to the use of multiple techniques to help mitigate the risk of one security measure being compromised or circumvented. These techniques are often a combination of information protection and physical protection measures.

One example is a building with an electronic card reader to permit and deny access, and a receptionist in the same building who checks credentials before allowing access. An additional defensive measure would be training all employees to verify building occupants are authorized to be there. With every measure that is added, security becomes ‚Äúdeeper‚Äù and risk is lessened.

## Let's summerize it up

We have learned about employees‚Äô physical protection responsibilities at work, at home, and while traveling.

Some specific topics covered include:

- Limit access to systems you‚Äôre responsible for to those who have a need-to-know.
- Protect systems and information (use password-protected screen savers, lock office doors, lock information in cabinets, etc.) when leaving them unattended.
- When traveling, pay special attention when going through airport security. Thieves may be able to steal your laptop while you are focusing on getting through the security checkpoint.
- Never leave systems or storage media in your vehicle.
- Protect work systems and information at home at the same level or higher as you would at work.

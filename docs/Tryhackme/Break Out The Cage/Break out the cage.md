Hey Cage!

There's rumours of a Face/Off sequel, Face/Off 2 - Face On. It's supposedly only in the
planning stages at the moment. I've put a good word in for you, if you're lucky we
might be able to get you a part of an angry shop keeping or something? Would you be up
for that, the money would be good and it'd look good on your acting CV.

Regards

Sean Archer

Dear Sean

We've had this discussion before Sean, I want bigger roles, I'm meant for greater things.
Why aren't you finding roles like Batman, The Little Mermaid(I'd make a great Sebastian!),
the new Home Alone film and why oh why Sean, tell me why Sean. Why did I not get a role in the
new fan made Star Wars films?! There was 3 of them! 3 Sean! I mean yes they were terrible films.
I could of made them great... great Sean.... I think you're missing my true potential.

On a much lighter note thank you for helping me set up my home server, Weston helped too, but
not overally greatly. I gave him some smaller jobs. Whats your username on here? Root?

Yours

Cage

Hey Son

Buddy, Sean left a note on his desk with some really strange writing on it. I quickly wrote
down what it said. Could you look into it please? I think it could be something to do with his
account on here. I want to know what he's hiding from me... I might need a new agent. Pretty
sure he's out to get me. The note said:

haiinspsyanileph

The guy also seems obsessed with my face lately. He came him wearing a mask of my face...
was rather odd. Imagine wearing his ugly face.... I wouldnt be able to FACE that!!
hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaahah get it Weston! FACE THAT!!!! hahahahahahahhaha
ahahahhahaha. Ahhh Face it... he's just odd.

Regards

The Legend - Cage

Good Evening Master

My control over Cage is becoming stronger, I've been casting him into worse and worse roles.
Eventually the whole world will see who Cage really is! Our masterplan is coming together

Dear Sean

I'm very pleased to here that Sean, you are a good disciple. Your power over him has become
strong... so strong that I feel the power to promote you from disciple to crony. I hope you
don't abuse your new found strength. To ascend yourself to this level please use this code:

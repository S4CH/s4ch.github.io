Before we do anything else, we need to get an idea of the \u201clandscape\u201d we are attacking. What this means is that we need to establish which services are running on the targets. For example, perhaps one of them is running a webserver, and another is acting as a Windows Active Directory Domain Controller. The first stage in establishing this \u201cmap\u201d of the landscape is something called port scanning. When a computer runs a network service, it opens a networking construct called a \u201cport\u201d to receive the connection.  Ports are necessary for making multiple network requests or having multiple services available. For example, when you load several webpages at once in a web browser, the program must have some way of determining which tab is loading which web page. This is done by establishing connections to the remote webservers using different ports on your local machine. Equally, if you want a server to be able to run more than one service (for example, perhaps you want your webserver to run both HTTP and HTTPS versions of the site), then you need some way to direct the traffic to the appropriate service. Once again, ports are the solution to this. Network connections are made between two ports \u2013 an open port listening on the server and a randomly selected port on your own computer. For example, when you connect to a web page, your computer may open port 49534 to connect to the server\u2019s port 443."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,(0,o.kt)("img",{parentName:"p",src:"https://i.imgur.com/3XAfRpI.png",alt:null})),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"As in the previous example, the diagram shows what happens when you connect to numerous websites at the same time.

For example, a HTTP Webservice can nearly always be found on port 80 of the server. A HTTPS Webservice can be found on port 443. Windows NETBIOS can be found on port 139 and SMB can be found on port 445. It is important to note; however, that especially in a CTF setting, it is not unheard of for even these standard ports to be altered, making it even more imperative that we perform appropriate enumeration on the target."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"If we do not know which of these ports a server has open, then we do not have a hope of successfully attacking the target; thus, it is crucial that we begin any attack with a port scan. This can be accomplished in a variety of ways \u2013 usually using a tool called nmap, which is the focus of this room. Nmap can be used to perform many different kinds of port scan \u2013 the most common these will be introduced in upcoming tasks; however, the basic theory is this: nmap will connect to each port of the target in turn. Depending on how the port responds, it can be determined as being open, closed, or filtered (usually by a firewall). Once we know which ports are open, we can then look at enumerating which services are running on each port \u2013 either manually, or more commonly using nmap."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"So, why nmap?
